# text_analysor
I've been working on a project focused on text mining and analysis. I developed a comprehensive text mining interface that allows users to upload documents, analyze word frequencies, generate frequency diagrams, model topics, and even discover specific content using keyword searches. 

Key features of our project:
- 📑 Document Upload: Users can easily upload PDF documents for analysis.
- 📈 Word Frequency Analysis: The system calculates and visualizes word frequency.
- 📰 Topic Modeling: We use advanced NLP techniques to model topics in the uploaded documents.
- ☁️ Word Clouds: Visualize the most prominent words in your text.
- 🔍 Keyword Search: Quickly find specific content within your documents.
